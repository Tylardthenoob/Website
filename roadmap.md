### Goals of This Site
<!-- Definitely add more here -->
This website is designed to help give additional exposure to the [[AU] Always United server](https://discord.gg/MFQQA9S).
### Ideas for the website
This section is constantly evolving but these are some preliminary ideas for now
* Create a page dedicated to the announcements portion of the server
* Create a page dedicated to various stats of the Discord server. Very similarly to the **Server Stats** portion of the server.
* Create a page to interact with the various polls in announcements channel.
* Create a page for the rules of the server
* Create a way for players to both spectate other players as well as join their group (if their group is made public).
* Create some type of system for hosting tournaments more effectively than is currently done
* Background music maybe?

### Actual Implementation
The website should first be implemented with limit amounts of styling/CSS/Bootstrap due to the fact the exact theme of the website is not yet clear.  The backend will be done using Flask in Python.  In order to retrieve the information from the Discord server (mentioned in more detail above) a discord bot will need to be created.  This probably should be the first task to be completed before moving forward with website.
